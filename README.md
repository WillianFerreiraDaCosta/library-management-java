- **Singleton Pattern** for centralized management

## Features
* Register new books and students  
* List catalog and registered students  
* Loan and return books (availability control)  
* Simple menu-based CLI interface

## What I Learned

Practice with Object-Oriented Programming (classes, encapsulation, constructors)

Implementation of Singleton Pattern

Experience with ArrayList for data management

Development of a simple menu-based CLI application

##  How to Run
